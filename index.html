      <p>I used to operate my site as a way to network with people in the tech and startup communities. I was lucky enough to meet a lot of great people.</p>
      <p>Allowing yourself to be accessible in such a public way leads to a lot of spam. It got to the point where I was sifting through metric tons of recruiter spam, sales calls, and emails from startup founders that didn't respect my time just to find the needle in the haystack that was communication from genuine people who were truly interested in exchanging knowledge.</p>
      <p>I wasn't about to let talking about work get in the way of actually doing work, so the public internet presence had to go.</p>
      <p>Best of luck out there.</p>
